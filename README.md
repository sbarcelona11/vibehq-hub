## 📱 Web Platform — Control Your Agents From Anywhere

VibeHQ includes a **full web dashboard** that lets you manage all your AI agent teams from a browser — desktop or phone. No remote desktop, no SSH, no VPN. Just open a URL and you have full control.

**Start agents from your desk. Monitor them from your couch. Fix issues from your phone.**

### Desktop

### Mobile — Full Control From Your Phone

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d056e18-44ea-418a-8831-dafc5cb724b8

### What You Can Do

- **Create & manage teams** — add agents, assign roles, set working directories
- **Start/stop agents** — one click to launch or kill any agent or entire team
- **Live terminals** — real-time xterm.js terminals for every agent, right in the browser
- **Send instructions** — type commands directly into any agent's terminal
- **Monitor tasks** — see active tasks, artifacts, and team updates per team
- **Mobile-optimized** — responsive UI with touch-friendly terminal controls (arrow keys, Ctrl+C, Tab, etc.)
- **LAN access** — server binds to `0.0.0.0`, any device on your network can connect
- **Optional auth** — set `VIBEHQ_AUTH=user:pass` to enable basic authentication

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start the web platform
node dist/bin/web.js

# With authentication (recommended for LAN access)
VIBEHQ_AUTH=admin:secret node dist/bin/web.js

# Custom ports
node dist/bin/web.js --port 8080 --hub-port 4001
```

The server prints your LAN IP on startup — open that URL on your phone and you're in.

### Remote Access (Outside Your LAN)

By default, the web platform is only accessible on your local network. To access it from anywhere (coffee shop, travel, another office), you'll need to expose the server securely.

> ⚠️ **Security Warning:** VibeHQ gives full terminal access to your machine — anyone who can reach the web UI can start agents, run commands, and read output. **Never expose it to the internet without authentication.**

**Always enable auth before exposing remotely:**
```bash
VIBEHQ_AUTH=admin:your-strong-password vibehq-web
```

#### Recommended Methods

| Method | Difficulty | Best For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)** | Easiest | Personal use — installs on PC + phone, creates a private VPN. No ports to open, no config. Free tier available. |
| **[Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/)** | Easy | Sharing with others — gives you a public `*.cfargotunnel.com` URL behind Cloudflare's network. Free. |
| **[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)** | Easy | Quick testing — `ngrok http 3100` gives a temporary public URL. Free tier has limits. |
| **SSH Tunnel** | Medium | If you have a VPS — `ssh -R 8080:localhost:3100 your-server`. No extra software needed. |
| **Router Port Forwarding** | Hard | Not recommended — requires static IP or DDNS, opens your network directly to the internet. |

#### Example: Tailscale (Recommended)

1. Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download) on your PC and phone
2. Sign in on both devices
3. Start VibeHQ: `VIBEHQ_AUTH=admin:secret vibehq-web`
4. On your phone, open `http://<tailscale-ip>:3100`
5. Done — encrypted, no port forwarding, works from anywhere

#### Example: Cloudflare Tunnel

```bash
# Install cloudflared and authenticate
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create vibehq

# Expose your local server
cloudflared tunnel route dns vibehq agents.yourdomain.com
cloudflared tunnel run --url http://localhost:3100 vibehq
```

#### Security Checklist

- [ ] **Always set `VIBEHQ_AUTH`** — without it, anyone with the URL has full access
- [ ] **Use HTTPS** — Tailscale and Cloudflare Tunnel handle this automatically; ngrok does too
- [ ] **Don't use port forwarding** unless you understand the risks
- [ ] **Use strong passwords** — the basic auth credentials travel with every request
- [ ] **Consider who can see your agents' output** — terminals may contain API keys, secrets, or sensitive code

## 🧩 The Problem

You can talk to a single AI coding agent. But **real software isn't built by one person**.

Every serious project needs a PM to coordinate, a designer to spec the UI, a backend engineer to define the API, a frontend engineer to build the interface, and QA to verify everything works. When you try to do all of this with one agent, you get:

- 🧠 **Context collapse** — one agent can't hold PM + FE + BE + QA context simultaneously
- 🔄 **No specialization** — every prompt is a context switch
- 🚫 **No process** — no specs, no reviews, no contracts, just vibes
- 💬 **No collaboration** — agents can't talk to each other, review each other's work, or block on dependencies

**The industry is full of "multi-agent frameworks" that are really just chain-of-thought with extra steps.** They run sequentially, in the same process, with synthetic conversations. That's not collaboration — that's a pipeline.

## 💡 The Solution

VibeHQ takes a fundamentally different approach: **real CLI agents, real terminals, real collaboration.**

```
You give ONE prompt to the PM.
7 agents build an entire application.
Each agent runs in its own terminal.
They communicate through a structured protocol.
They don't start coding until specs are signed off.
```

Every agent is a **real instance** of Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI — running in its own terminal window, with its own working directory, its own file access scope, its own conversation context. The Hub doesn't simulate conversations. It routes messages, manages tasks, enforces contracts, and queues work until agents are ready.

**Because each agent is a real CLI process, all native CLI features work out of the box:**
- 🔧 **Claude Code**: Skills, custom MCP servers, `.claude/` project config, memory, all CLI flags
- 🔧 **Codex CLI**: Built-in tools, file editing, terminal commands, custom instructions
- 🔧 **Gemini CLI**: Extensions, Google Cloud integrations, `.gemini/` config

VibeHQ **adds** 20 collaboration tools on top — it never replaces or limits anything the CLI can already do. Your agents keep their full power; they just gain the ability to talk to each other.

**This is the difference between "multi-agent" and "multi-agent collaboration."**

## 📊 Benchmarks

Tested on a controlled task: "Analyze $NVDA and build an interactive HTML dashboard"
with identical team composition (1 orchestrator + 3 workers) across framework versions.

| | V1 (Before) | V2 (After) | Single Agent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Time | 107 min | 58 min | 9.5 min |
| Final Output | ❌ Broken | ✅ Working (62KB) | ✅ Working (70KB) |
| Schema Conflicts | 15 | 2 | 0 |
| Manual Code Fixes by Orchestrator | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| Data Errors Caught by QA | 0 (no QA) | 7 | 0 (no QA) |

**Key improvements V1 → V2:**
- Structured task contracts (`output_target`, `REQUIRED INPUTS`) eliminated schema mismatches
- Agent heartbeat monitoring auto-detects offline agents within 60s
- QA validation phase catches data errors before final delivery
- Zero orchestrator code interventions (vs 6 manual JS patches in V1)

**When to use multi-agent vs single agent:**
Multi-agent adds value when tasks require independent QA verification,
heterogeneous tool access, or workloads exceeding a single context window.
For small-scope tasks, a single agent is significantly faster.

## 🔬 Why This Architecture Matters

### Real Agent Isolation
Each agent runs as a **separate OS process** in its own PTY (pseudo-terminal). This isn't threads or coroutines — it's full process isolation. An agent's crash doesn't take down the team. An agent's context window is entirely its own. This is how real engineering teams work: separate machines, separate contexts, shared protocols.

### Contract-Driven Development
Before any code is written, specs must be published and signed. `publish_contract("api-spec.md", ["Jordan", "Sam"])` requires the frontend engineer AND designer to approve the API schema before the backend starts coding. This eliminates the #1 cause of multi-agent failure: **agents building against different assumptions.**

### Idle-Aware Message Queue
When Agent A sends a task to Agent B, and Agent B is in the middle of writing code, the message **doesn't interrupt**. It queues. When B finishes (detected via Claude Code's JSONL transcript or PTY output timeout), the queue flushes. This prevents the "new instruction mid-task" problem that destroys agent output quality.

### State Persistence
All tasks, artifacts, contracts, and team updates persist to disk (`~/.vibehq/teams/<team>/hub-state.json`). Hub restarts don't lose state. Agents can reconnect and pick up where they left off.

### MCP-Native Communication
Agents don't communicate through prompt injection hacks. They use **20 purpose-built MCP tools** that are auto-configured when each agent spawns. The tools are type-safe, the messages are structured, and the Hub validates everything.

---

## ⚡️ Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** ≥ 18
- At least one AI CLI installed:
  - [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
  - [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) (`npm install -g @openai/codex`)
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/gemini-cli`)

### Install (Build from Source)

> ⚠️ `npm install -g @vibehq/agent-hub` is not yet available on npm. The package will be published after registry registration is complete. For now, use the build & link method:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x0funky/vibehq-hub.git
cd vibehq-hub
npm install
npm run build
npm run build:web
npm link
```

This globally registers `vibehq`, `vibehq-spawn`, `vibehq-hub`, `vibehq-web`, and `vibehq-analyze` commands.

### Launch — Web Platform (Recommended)

```bash
# Start web dashboard — accessible from desktop & mobile
vibehq-web

# With authentication for LAN access
VIBEHQ_AUTH=admin:secret vibehq-web

# Custom ports
vibehq-web --port 8080 --hub-port 4001
```

Open the printed URL in your browser. On mobile, use the LAN IP shown in the console.

### Launch — TUI Mode (Windows Terminal)

```bash
vibehq
```

Select a team → Start → agents spawn in new Windows Terminal tabs.

### Launch — Manual Mode (Mac / Linux)

The TUI auto-spawn currently targets Windows Terminal (`wt`), iTerm2, and standard Linux terminals. If the TUI doesn't spawn terminals correctly on your system, you can start agents manually:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the Hub
vibehq-hub --port 3001

# Terminal 2: Spawn agent
cd /path/to/frontend
vibehq-spawn --name "Jordan" --role "Frontend Engineer" \
  --team "my-team" --hub "ws://localhost:3001" \
  --add-dir "/path/to/shared" \
  -- claude

# Terminal 3: Spawn another agent
cd /path/to/backend
vibehq-spawn --name "Riley" --role "Backend Engineer" \
  --team "my-team" --hub "ws://localhost:3001" \
  -- claude

# Repeat for each agent...
```

### Respawn a Single Agent

If an agent crashes or disconnects, respawn it without restarting the team:

```bash
cd D:\project\qa
vibehq-spawn --name "Casey" --role "QA Engineer" \
  --team "medvault" --hub "ws://localhost:3002" \
  --skip-permissions \
  --add-dir "D:\project\frontend" \
  --add-dir "D:\project\backend" \
  -- claude
```

## ⚠️ Platform Support

> **VibeHQ is developed on Windows and tested on both Windows and macOS.**

| Feature | Windows | Mac | Linux |
|---------|---------|-----|-------|
| Web Platform (browser + mobile) | ✅ Tested | ✅ Should work | ✅ Should work |
| TUI (interactive team launcher) | ✅ Tested | ✅ Tested (Terminal.app/iTerm2) | ⚠️ Untested (gnome-terminal/xterm/tmux) |
| Hub server | ✅ Tested | ✅ Tested | ✅ Should work |
| Manual spawn (`vibehq-spawn`) | ✅ Tested | ✅ Tested | ✅ Should work |
| Claude JSONL idle detection | ✅ Tested | ✅ Tested | ⚠️ Path encoding may differ |
| PTY spawning (node-pty) | ✅ Tested | ✅ Tested | ⚠️ Untested |
| MCP auto-configuration | ✅ Tested | ✅ Tested | ⚠️ Config paths may differ |

### Potential Issues on Mac/Linux

- **Terminal spawning**: The TUI uses `wt` (Windows Terminal) on Windows, `osascript` with temp launcher scripts on Mac (iTerm2 → Terminal.app → `open` fallback), and `gnome-terminal`/`xterm`/`tmux` on Linux. If your terminal emulator isn't detected, use manual `vibehq-spawn` commands instead.
- **Claude JSONL path encoding**: Claude Code encodes project paths differently on each OS (`\` vs `/`). The watcher uses regex replacement that should handle both, but edge cases may exist.
- **node-pty compilation**: `node-pty` requires native compilation. On Mac, ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed (`xcode-select --install`). On Linux, ensure `build-essential` and `python3` are available.
- **node-pty spawn-helper permission (macOS)**: The prebuilt `spawn-helper` binary may be installed without executable permission (`0644`). Our `postinstall` script fixes this automatically. If you still see `posix_spawnp failed`, run: `chmod +x node_modules/node-pty/prebuilds/*/spawn-helper`
- **MCP config paths**: Claude stores MCP config at `~/.claude/` on all platforms, but Codex (`~/.codex/`) and Gemini (`~/.gemini/`) paths may vary.
- **File path separators**: Config file paths use `\\` for Windows. On Mac/Linux, use `/` instead.

> 🐧 **Linux testing is coming soon.** The architecture supports Linux terminals and tmux — once verified, this section will be updated.

### Data Flow

1. **PM** calls `create_task("Build login page", ..., "Jordan")` via MCP
2. **Hub** stores the task, checks Jordan's status
3. Jordan is **working** → task enters the **message queue**
4. Jordan finishes current work → **JSONL watcher** detects `turn_duration` event → status = `idle`
5. Hub **flushes queue** → Jordan receives the task
6. Jordan calls `accept_task` → writes code → calls `complete_task` with artifact
7. Hub **persists** everything to disk, **broadcasts** status to team
8. **Web dashboard** shows all of this in real-time — from any device

---

## 📝 Configuration

### `vibehq.config.json`

```jsonc
{
  "teams": [
    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "hub": { "port": 3001 },
      "agents": [
        {
          "name": "Alex",
          "role": "Project Manager",       // Auto-loads preset system prompt
          "cli": "codex",
          "cwd": "D:\\my-project"          // Use "/" on Mac/Linux
        },
        {
          "name": "Jordan",
          "role": "Frontend Engineer",
          "cli": "claude",
          "cwd": "D:\\my-project\\frontend",
          "dangerouslySkipPermissions": true,
          "additionalDirs": ["D:\\my-project\\shared"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Agent Config Reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | *required* | Agent display name (unique per team) |
| `role` | `string` | *required* | Role — auto-loads matching preset if no `systemPrompt` |
| `cli` | `string` | *required* | `claude`, `codex`, or `gemini` |
| `cwd` | `string` | *required* | Working directory (isolated per agent) |
| `systemPrompt` | `string?` | preset | Custom system prompt (overrides role preset) |
| `dangerouslySkipPermissions` | `bool?` | `false` | Skip Claude permission prompts (Claude only) |
| `additionalDirs` | `string[]?` | `[]` | Extra directories the agent can access (Claude `--add-dir`) |

### Built-in Role Presets

When `systemPrompt` is omitted, VibeHQ auto-loads a V2-aware prompt based on the `role` field:

| Role | Focus |
|------|-------|
| Project Manager | Task delegation, spec-first workflow, progress tracking |
| Product Designer | Design specs, contract review, visual QA |
| Frontend Engineer | UI development, contract-first API integration |
| Backend Engineer | API-first development, contract publishing |
| AI Engineer | ML pipeline, model integration |
| QA Engineer | Test planning, cross-module verification |

All presets include the full list of 20 MCP tools and enforce the contract-first workflow.

## 📂 Team Data & Storage

All team collaboration data is persisted to disk under your home directory:

```
~/.vibehq/
  └── teams/
      └── <team-name>/
          ├── hub-state.json       # Team updates, tasks, artifacts, contracts
          └── shared/              # Files shared via share_file() and publish_artifact()
```

| Data | Persisted? | Location |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Team updates (`post_update`) | ✅ | `hub-state.json` |
| Tasks (`create_task`, `complete_task`) | ✅ | `hub-state.json` |
| Contracts (`publish_contract`) | ✅ | `hub-state.json` |
| Shared files (`share_file`) | ✅ | `shared/` folder |
| Artifacts (`publish_artifact`) | ✅ | `shared/` folder |
| Agent messages (`ask_teammate`, `reply_to_team`) | ❌ | Real-time relay only |

> 💡 **Tip:** To review your team's collaboration history, check `~/.vibehq/teams/<team-name>/hub-state.json`. Shared files are directly accessible in the `shared/` folder.

## 📊 Post-Run Analytics

After a team session ends, analyze the JSONL logs to understand what went well and what didn't.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Analyze a session (directory of JSONL logs or single file)
vibehq-analyze ./data

# Save results and get LLM-powered insights
vibehq-analyze ./data --save --with-llm

# View as JSON
vibehq-analyze ./data --json
```

### Analysis Pipeline

```
JSONL Logs ──► Normalizer ──► Metrics ──► Pattern Detection ──► Report
  (Claude +      (Stage 0)    (Stage 1)     (Stage 2)          ┃
   Codex)                                                       ▼
                                                          LLM Analyst
                                                           (Stage 3)
                                                               ┃
                                                               ▼
                                                        History Store
                                                           (Stage 4)
```

### 13 Automated Detection Rules

| Rule | Severity | What It Detects |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| `ARTIFACT_REGRESSION` | Critical | Agent's output size decreased between attempts (content regression) |
| `ORCHESTRATOR_ROLE_DRIFT` | Critical | Orchestrator used implementation tools (Write/Edit/Bash) |
| `STUB_FILE` | High | Agent published placeholder/stub instead of full content |
| `TASK_TIMEOUT` | High | Task took longer than 15 minutes |
| `INCOMPLETE_TASK` | High | Task was never completed |
| `HIGH_COORDINATION_OVERHEAD` | High | Orchestrator consumed >30% of output tokens |
| `AGENT_UNRESPONSIVE` | High | Agent never connected or completed zero tasks |
| `NO_ARTIFACTS_PRODUCED` | High | Worker agent produced zero artifacts |
| `CONTEXT_BLOAT` | Medium | Agent context grew more than 5x during session |
| `DUPLICATE_ARTIFACT` | Medium | Multiple agents produced same filename |
| `PREMATURE_TASK_ACCEPT` | Medium/Info | Agent accepted task within 10s of creation |
| `EXCESSIVE_MCP_POLLING` | Low | Agent called check_status/list_tasks >20 times |
| `TASK_REASSIGNED` | Info | Task was reassigned to a different agent |

### Run History & Comparison

```bash
# View past runs
vibehq-analyze history --last 10

# Compare two runs side-by-side
vibehq-analyze compare run-v1 run-v2

# Show a saved run
vibehq-analyze show <run-id>

# List all saved run IDs
vibehq-analyze list
```

### LLM Analysis Configuration

```bash
# Configure API key (persisted to ~/.vibehq/analytics/config.json)
vibehq-analyze config --set-key sk-ant-xxx
vibehq-analyze config --set-provider anthropic   # or openai
vibehq-analyze config --set-model claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Show current config
vibehq-analyze config
```

Config priority: CLI flags > env vars (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`) > `~/.vibehq/analytics/config.json` > `vibehq.config.json` (model/provider only)

> ⚠️ **Security:** API keys are never read from `vibehq.config.json` since it's tracked by git. Always use `config --set-key` (saves to `~/.vibehq/`) or environment variables.

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs welcome. The architecture is modular:
- **New MCP tool?** Add to `src/mcp/tools/` + register in `hub-client.ts`
- **New CLI support?** Add detection in `spawner.ts` + MCP config in `autoConfigureMcp()`
- **New dashboard widget?** Extend `src/tui/screens/dashboard.ts` or `web/src/components/`
